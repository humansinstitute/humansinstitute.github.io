> "Hmmmm.... this rabbit hole is deep. I sure wish it was a little bit less fucking confusing"

I'm going to attribute this quote to almost everyone who once thought to themselves, "so I wonder what this bitcoin thing is all about" and then surfaced about six months later - you know who you are.

The purpose of this little website is to try and demystify some of the concepts in the bitcoin ecosystem through a series of pictures, white board explainers, annologies and short stories.  Hopefully with a little bit of humour thrown in.

I feel like I spend around about 1000 hours a day listening to podcasts reading articles and thinking critically about all this stuff, but in reality I know that I work best visually in front of a big whiteboard.  

So with that in mind instead of trying to write ever more complex explainers in medium that I never publish, I figured I'd stick to the knitting and build a website of recorded whiteboard sessions and commedy anecdotes instead.

Why BIPS? Well its a pun on BIPS... but also stands for bitcoin in Pictures and Stories.

You see I said there'd be humour.
