So I was listening to the excellent discussion bewteen [Stephan Livera and Joost Jager](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/68) on loop out and whilst this gave an excellent overview of the concept I felt I really needed to draw this out to understand how the flow worked and how it was made trustless.

The following quick whiteboard recording is how I thought through this, hopefully this is useful and as always its under creative commons so feel free to share away :)

First time recording one of these, so if it's a little rough around the edges or you have question let me know at: [bitcoin.in.pictures.stories@gmail.com](mailto:bitcoin.in.pictures.stories@gmail.com) and I can always recorded again at a later date and update anything technical I got wrong.
