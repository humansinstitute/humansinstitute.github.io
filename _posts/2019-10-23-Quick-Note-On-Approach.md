In general you’re gong to see a number of different themes running throughout this work. 

For example if you saw me in real life you’d often hear me state that people like “stories, analogies and things that come in threes” usually before I then tell a story, give an example via analogy or suggest three options for something we’re talking about :)

For example its no coincidence that we have bitcoin (1), energy (2) and (3) freedom for humans :) 

Likewise I feel there’s a lot of millage to be had from describing things in abstract stories and analogies as I find these interest people and really stick in peoples mind. 

I’ve been considering building these into some form of framework, but in reality it’s been a hurdle to get over (analogy alert) and it’s just meant I’ve not put anything out there, so instead I’m just going to start publishing these things!

Really I just wanted to introduce this to explain why some things look the way they do, as we build things out I’m just going to start dumping content into the site (to be fair no-one is reading it right now!) and then I’ll worry about tidying it up later. 

Cheers!
