Hash time lock contracts keep coming up at the moment, so I figured it might be worth a quick video to try and explain whats going on.

Here's another quick whiteboard, still getting used to recording these so if there's any advice, feedback or something you think I've moissed let me know and I'll have another go. As always opefully this is useful and its under creative commons so distribute, remix and share away :)

Get in touch with any feedback to: [bitcoin.in.pictures.stories@gmail.com](mailto:bitcoin.in.pictures.stories@gmail.com) and I can always recorded again at a later date and update anything technical I got wrong.
