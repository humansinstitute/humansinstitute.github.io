There were humans, they lived in tribes and they had a simple motto…  
>“You guys are cool we’ll look after each other and help each other out in times of need... <br />but f*%k those guys over the hill, we’ll kill them…”

But they met those tribes and did the dance of the two backed beast. They became villages which became city states with the motto:  “You guys are cool we’ll look after each other and help each other out in times of need... but f*%k the guys in that city, we will kill them…”

Better, but not great.  But as time passes more sex is had and our circle is geting wider bit the motto still feels familiar:  “Ok, you guys with my ideology/religion/geopgraphy are fine, we’ll look after each other... but those others with that ideology/religion/geography can f*%k right off!”

We’re getting better, but at The Humans Institute, we want to see a world where technology help's us realise some of the promises of global capitalism, as summarised in the following motto..

>“Ok, we’re all humans and we’re all cool.  We’re going to just work together and look after each other… <br />But of course those fuckers on Mars…”
