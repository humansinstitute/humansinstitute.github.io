bitcoin is **pretty bloody complex**.  All of a sudden you're expected to know about; game theory, 
economics, technology and cryptography just to figure out what's going on.

The good news is there's a truck load of content for you to consume as you fall deeper and deeper
into this new wonderland.  The bad news is that a "truck load" is a lot of content and it gets confusing.

So this site is all about taking these concepts and trying to explain them thorugh a series of 
pictures and short stories, with a touch of humour if we can manage it. 

BIPS. **B**itcoin **I**n **P**ictures and **S**tories.
