At the Humans.Institute we believe that we do our best work, when we remember that we're Humans.  We believe that we build our best tech when we remember, we're building it for Humans.  We believe that money, society and politics work best when they work for Humans.  

But we also know from first hand experience it can be hard to keep this in mind when working on something big.

So the purpose of the Humans.Institute is to begin building content to make this easier.  We want to build a repo of Complex Systems Models, UX research, Prototype Designs, Technical Designs and Implementations to apply leverage, when you want to tackle a big problem.

We believe the biggest shift in progress right now, is the seperation of money and state.  We believe this will have far reaching consequences.  As such we will be focusing initial efforts on the applicaitons of models and design to support **bitcoin** in this goal.
