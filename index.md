The Humans Institute is a think tank, seeking to generate open source thinking on the major issues and opportunities affecting people in the world today. 

We have three focus areas: **Energy**, **Bitcoin** and **Freedom**. 

We believe all three are interrelated and that educating, empowering and guiding developments in these three areas will provide the highest leverage to improve livings standards for humans globally.

In order to contribute to these debates we intend to promote ****open source thinking**** in each of these areas of debate. 

This will take the form of curating and generating freely available and commercially re-usable assets under creative commons licensing framework.

Over time we will seek to monetise this HI, through private consulting engagements assisting entrepreneurs in developing products and services in line with these frameworks and developing orthogonal products and services which draw on our body of work.

We expect each section to develop slowly, however if you’d like to contribute to speed things up please get in touch we’d be glad for your help.

For each of our focus areas we will be focussing on three areas of 

* **Context:** Quick brief unstructured content you can soak up for context on this space, including curated links to other sources. 
* **Thought:** More in-depth thinking exploring ideas that are developed in the context sections.
* **Frameworks:** Design thinking frameworks for applying this knowledge in the world for  commercial enterprise and policy considerations.
